# Twilio
Using Twilio's API to send sms messages. 

I decided to mess around with Twilio's API to become more familiar with it. I was inspired by the guy who created a fake girlfriend to text while all his friends were texting their real girlfriends (http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/22/fakegirlfriend-co-lets-you-text-with-your-made-up-canadian-model-girlfriend/). You must have node.js and express.js to run the file. In the command line, once you're in the Twilio directory, type the command: node index.js. It should give you a message like Example app listening at http://:::3000, so go into your web browser and type localhost:3000. If it works, then you're good to go. Make sure to set up a temporary Twilio account for yourself (https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/how-does-twilios-free-trial-work) so you can send and recieve texts.
